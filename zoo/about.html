                <h2>Auckland zoo</h2>
                <p>Auckland Zoo (Māori: Rawhi Whakaaturanga o Tāmaki Makaurau)[5] is a 16.35-hectare (40-acre) zoological garden in Auckland, New Zealand, situated next to Western Springs Park not far from Auckland's central business district. It is run by Auckland Council with the Zoological Society of Auckland as a supporting organisation. Auckland Zoo opened in 1922, experiencing early difficulties mainly due to animal health issues. By 1930 a sizeable collection of animals had been assembled and a zoological society formed. The zoo consolidated during the Second World War and was at that time under the leadership of Lt. Col. Sawer. After the war the collection was expanded. In the 1950s, chimpanzees were acquired to provide tea parties for the public's entertainment, but this practice ceased in 1964. In 1973 the zoo expanded into the adjacent Western Springs Park. From the late 1980s to the present day, many old exhibits were phased out and replaced by modern enclosures. In 2011 the zoo opened its largest development, Te Wao Nui, which exhibits native New Zealand flora and fauna. The zoo is loosely separated into areas defined by the region of origin of the species exhibited, its taxonomy, or by biome. The zoo plays a part in conservation (mainly of New Zealand species), research and education. It has many modern features such as the New Zealand Centre for Conservation Medicine (NZCCM). Auckland Zoo is a full institutional member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA), and received ISO 14001 accreditation for its Environmental Management System in 2007.[1]</p>
